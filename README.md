# SmartPointer Dynamic Array and Summation

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **smart pointers** in C++ (`std::unique_ptr`) to dynamically allocate an array of integers, fill it with user input, and compute the sum of its elements.

Smart pointers provide automatic memory management, ensuring safe and efficient use of dynamically allocated memory in modern C++ programs.

## Features
- **Dynamic Array Allocation**: The program dynamically allocates an array of integers based on the user's input.
- **Memory Management**: Uses `std::unique_ptr` to handle memory safely, eliminating the need for manual `delete[]` calls.
- **Array Population**: The user provides values to fill the array.
- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the array's elements is calculated and displayed.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
